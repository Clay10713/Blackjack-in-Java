Blackjack simmulation in Java

This program executes the basic logic of the Blackjack game between two players: human-player and casino-player.
The Casino-player follows simple "stand on 17" rule. Human-player interacts with user utilizing standard input/standard output.
This implementation supports the following BlackJack actions:

    HIT - Player takes one card from Dealer
                    
    STAY - Player makes a current hand final
                    
Currently working on the issue when the game ends abruptly after either busting or winning and working on the gui interface.
                    
Installation: 
      Download and unpack the source code to the download folder.
      There should be a FinishedGame.Jar and a RUN.BAT file.
Usage:
      Once the files are unzipped, you can run the code by invoking the RUN.Bat file.
